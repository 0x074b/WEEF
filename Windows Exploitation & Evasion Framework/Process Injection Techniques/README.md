# Basic Code Injection
*(Techniques that rely on well-documented Windows API functions and are easier to detect.)*

- **APC Injection** → Uses Asynchronous Procedure Calls (APC) to execute code in another process.
- **DLL Injection** → Loads a malicious DLL into a remote process via LoadLibrary().
- **DLL Hijacking** → Places a malicious DLL where a legitimate application will load it.
- **Hook Injection** → Modifies function hooks (e.g., API hooking) to alter program behavior.
- **PE Injection** → Injects a full Portable Executable (PE) into a remote process.
- **Queue User APC Injection** → Similar to APC Injection but uses QueueUserAPC().
- **Remote Thread Injection** → Creates a new thread in a remote process using CreateRemoteThread().
- **Shellcode Injection** → Injects shellcode into another process’s memory and executes it.

# Advanced Code Injection
*(Techniques that involve stealth, process replacement, or anti-detection mechanisms.)*

- **Atom Bombing** → Uses the Windows Atom Table to inject code into another process.
- **Code Stomping** → Overwrites executable code without modifying memory permissions.
- **Early Bird Injection** → Injects malicious code before the main thread starts running.
- **Heaven’s Gate Injection** → Uses 64-bit processes to execute 32-bit shellcode to bypass hooks.
- **PPID Spoofing** → Manipulates a process’s parent PID to appear as a trusted process.
- **Process Doppelgänging** → Uses NTFS transactions to replace a running process with a malicious one.
- **Process Ghosting** → Executes an EXE that has already been deleted to avoid detection.
- **Process Hollowing** → Starts a legitimate process and replaces its memory with malicious code.
- **Process Reimaging** → Overwrites an existing process’s memory with a different image.
- **Reflective DLL Injection** → Loads a DLL in memory without calling LoadLibrary().
- **Shellcode Reflective DLL Injection** → Combines shellcode injection with Reflective DLL Injection for stealth.
- **Thread Execution Hijacking** → Suspends a thread, modifies its execution context, and resumes it.
- **Thread Local Storage (TLS) Callback Injection** → Uses TLS callbacks to execute malicious code before main().
