# Bypassing Application Whitelisting
## What is Application Whitelisting?
*Application whitelisting is a **security mechanism** that only allows pre-approved applications to run on a system.
It is used to **block unauthorized execution of malicious code** and prevent attacks such as **ransomware** or **fileless malware execution**.*

## Why Attackers Bypass It?
*Application whitelisting is designed to **allow only approved applications to execute**, making it a powerful security measure.
However, attackers **actively seek ways to bypass it** for the following reasons:*

### 1. Execute Malicious Code Without Detection

- **Whitelisting prevents execution of unauthorized programs**.
- Attackers use **trusted Windows binaries (LOLBins)** or **signed binaries** to run malicious code while staying undetected.
- **Example**: Using ```mshta.exe``` to execute remote JavaScript payloads.

### 2. Maintain Persistence

- If an attacker **gains access to a system**, they want to maintain control.
- Bypassing whitelisting allows them to **establish persistence** using trusted processes.
- **Example**: Using COM hijacking or Image File Execution Options (IFEO) Hijacking.

### 3. Evade Antivirus (AV) and EDR Solutions

- Many security tools rely on detecting **unusual executable files**.
- By hijacking whitelisted processes, attackers **blend in with normal system activity**.
- **Example**: Using ```rundll32.exe``` to load a malicious DLL instead of running an EXE.

### 4. Execute Payloads Without Dropping Files (Fileless Attacks)

- Some whitelisting solutions focus on blocking unknown files.
- Attackers **inject malicious code into memory**, avoiding detection.
- **Example**: PowerShell execution via ```powershell -enc <base64_payload>```.

### 5. Bypass User Restrictions & Gain Higher Privileges

- Whitelisting is often used to **restrict what users can execute**.
- Attackers use signed binaries or hijacking methods to **escalate privileges and bypass restrictions**.
- **Example**: Using ```regsvr32.exe``` to execute malicious scripts with elevated rights.

### 6. Deploy Malware in Enterprise Environments

- Large organizations rely on **whitelisting to protect corporate endpoints**.
- Attackers must bypass it to deploy malware, ransomware, or spyware without raising alarms.
- **Example**: Using ```certutil.exe``` to download malware disguised as a certificate.

## How Attackers Bypass It?
*Attackers use various techniques to **execute unauthorized code despite whitelisting policies**, including:*

- **Abusing legitimate Windows binaries** (LOLbins) that are already whitelisted.
- **Using script-based execution** (PowerShell, VBA Macros).
- **Hijacking trusted processes** to load malicious payloads.
- **Using alternate execution paths** (registry, COM objects, etc.).
