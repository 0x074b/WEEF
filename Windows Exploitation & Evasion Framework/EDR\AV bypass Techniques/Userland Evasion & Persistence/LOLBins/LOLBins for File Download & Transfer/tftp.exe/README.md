# tfpt.exe
## What is it?
*```tfpt.exe``` (Team Foundation Power Tools) is a command-line utility that provides additional functionality for interacting with Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS) and Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS).*
*It is part of the **Team Foundation Server Power Tools** and enables developers to perform various operations such as managing source control, work items, and builds via the command line interface.*

## Legitimate Usage
- **Source Control Management** → Developers use ```tfpt.exe``` to manage source code repositories, including checking out, checking in, and branching code.
- **Work Item Management** → Allows developers to interact with work items and manage tasks, bugs, and user stories within the TFS system.
- **Build Automation** → Supports automation of build processes by interacting with TFS build definitions.
- **File Operations** → Provides advanced file manipulation options for TFS, such as undoing changes or getting specific revisions.

## How to abuse it
- **Bypassing Security Controls** → ```tfpt.exe``` is often trusted by security solutions because it's a legitimate TFS tool, which makes it useful for bypassing security restrictions or monitoring.
- **Privilege Escalation** → Attackers can manipulate TFS permissions or use the utility to access sensitive repositories and elevate their access privileges.
- **Data Exfiltration** → Malicious actors can use ```tfpt.exe``` to extract sensitive source code or project information from TFS repositories to external servers.
- **Persistence** → Attackers can use ```tfpt.exe``` to schedule operations or script tasks that maintain persistence in compromised systems.

## Example attacks
### 1. Data Exfiltration from TFS Repositories
*Attackers can use ```tfpt.exe``` to download sensitive files from TFS repositories without triggering alerts.*

**Extract Source Code to External Server**

```
tfpt.exe get $/Project/SourceCode /recursive /version:T /login:attacker,Password
```

**Effect:**
- Downloads the latest source code from the repository.
- **Bypasses traditional data exfiltration detection mechanisms** by using a trusted tool.

### 2. Bypassing Security Restrictions
*By using ```tfpt.exe``` with valid but stolen credentials, attackers can bypass security tools that only allow TFS-related processes to run.*

**Execute a Command to Bypass Restrictions**

```
tfpt.exe workspace /delete /collection:http://tfsserver:8080/tfs
```

**Effect:**
- Removes or manipulates TFS workspace configurations, potentially evading detection if TFS access is granted to the attacker.
- **Bypasses file restrictions** by using a legitimate tool.

### 3. Privilege Escalation via TFS Permissions
*Malicious users can escalate their privileges by using ```tfpt.exe``` to manipulate TFS permissions or access control settings.*

**Gain Access to Restricted Code Repositories**

```
tfpt.exe checkin /comment:"Escalated privileges" /force
```

**Effect:**
- Forces check-in of files to a restricted repository with escalated privileges, allowing the attacker to gain access to sensitive code.

### 4. Persistence via Scheduled TFS Operations
*Attackers can use ```tfpt.exe``` to set up scheduled tasks for continuous data extraction or system access persistence.*

**Create a Scheduled Task to Exfiltrate Data Regularly**

```
schtasks /create /tn "TFSBackup" /tr "tfpt.exe get $/Project/SourceCode /recursive" /sc hourly /ru SYSTEM
```

**Effect:**
- Runs the ```tfpt.exe``` command every hour, ensuring continuous exfiltration of source code and data.

# Detection & Mitigation
## Detection Methods
**Monitor TFS Usage**
- **TFS Logs** → Review logs for unusual use of ```tfpt.exe``` or unexpected commands, such as unauthorized check-ins or file downloads.
- **Command-Line Monitoring** → Watch for execution of ```tfpt.exe``` from non-administrative users or in unexpected contexts.

**Monitor File Transfers**
- **Look for Unusual Data Movements** → Detect large or unauthorized data transfers from TFS repositories to external locations.
- **Network Monitoring** → Monitor outbound traffic from TFS to detect unusual data exfiltration behavior.

## Mitigation Strategies
- **Limit Access to TFS Servers** → Restrict the use of ```tfpt.exe``` to trusted users, ensuring proper authentication and authorization are in place.
- **Use Application Whitelisting** → Prevent the execution of unapproved applications by implementing strong application control policies.
- **Audit TFS Permissions Regularly** → Ensure that TFS permissions are reviewed and that only authorized users have access to sensitive data repositories.
- **Implement Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** → Use IDS to monitor for abnormal command-line activity or file transfer patterns indicative of misuse of TFS tools like ```tfpt.exe```.
