# debug.exe  
## What is it?  
*```debug.exe``` is a **legacy Windows command-line tool** used for low-level debugging and assembly-level program analysis.*  
*It was included in older Windows versions (Windows XP and earlier) but has been **removed in modern versions** due to security risks.*  
*Attackers may still leverage it on older systems or **drop a custom version** to exploit its functionality.*  

## Legitimate Usage  
- **Assembly Debugging** → Analyze machine code and interact with CPU registers.  
- **Low-Level Program Testing** → Modify and test binary code directly.  
- **Disk & Memory Analysis** → Read/write data to specific memory addresses or disk sectors.  

## How to abuse it  
- **Code Execution via Debug Scripts** → Write and execute arbitrary machine code.  
- **Fileless Malware Execution** → Inject shellcode directly into memory.  
- **Binary Modification & Patching** → Tamper with executable files to bypass security.  
- **Dropping & Running Malicious Binaries** → Attackers can use ```debug.exe``` to assemble and run malware.  

## Example Attacks  
### 1. Writing and Executing Shellcode  
*Attackers can use ```debug.exe``` to write machine code into a file and execute it.*  

```
echo N malware.com > script.txt
echo E 100 B8 4D 5A CD 21 > script.txt
echo R CX > script.txt
echo 2 > script.txt
echo W > script.txt
echo Q > script.txt
debug < script.txt
```

**Effect:**  
- Creates a file (`malware.com`) with malicious instructions.  
- Writes and executes shellcode, potentially delivering malware.  

### 2. Fileless Malware Execution  
*Runs arbitrary shellcode without writing an actual executable to disk.*  

```
debug
-a 100
MOV AX, 4C00
INT 21
-r
g
```

**Effect:**  
- Executes raw machine instructions directly in memory.  
- **Avoids detection by traditional file-based security tools.**  

### 3. Modifying Executables for Evasion  
*Patch a binary to alter its behavior or bypass restrictions.*  

```
debug legitimate.exe
-e 0100 FF 90 90
-w
-q
```

**Effect:**  
- Edits a specific byte sequence inside `legitimate.exe`.  
- May disable security checks or introduce backdoors.  

### 4. Persistence via Debug Script  
*Creates a malicious startup executable and places it in a system directory.*  

```
echo N C:\Windows\System32\backdoor.exe > backdoor.txt
echo E 100 B8 4D 5A CD 21 > backdoor.txt
echo R CX > backdoor.txt
echo 2 > backdoor.txt
echo W > backdoor.txt
echo Q > backdoor.txt
debug < backdoor.txt
```

**Effect:**  
- Writes malicious machine code into an executable.  
- Places it in a **highly privileged system directory** for persistence.  

## Detection & Mitigation  
### Detection Methods  
- **Monitor Execution of `debug.exe`** → Rarely used in modern environments.  
- **Detect Debug Scripts** → Watch for suspicious batch scripts invoking ```debug.exe```.  
- **Look for Unauthorized Binary Modifications** → Unexpected changes in system executables.  

### Mitigation Strategies  
- **Remove `debug.exe` from systems** → It is deprecated and unnecessary in modern environments.  
- **Use Application Control (AppLocker, WDAC)** → Block execution of ```debug.exe```.  
- **Monitor Process Creation** → Unusual usage of ```debug.exe``` may indicate an attack.
