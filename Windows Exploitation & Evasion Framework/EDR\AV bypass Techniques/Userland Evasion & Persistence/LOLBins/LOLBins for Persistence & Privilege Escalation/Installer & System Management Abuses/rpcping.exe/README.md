# rpcping.exe
## What is it?
*```rpcping.exe``` is a Microsoft utility designed to test remote procedure call (RPC) communication between systems.*

*It is used to verify the availability and functionality of RPC services over a network, typically used for diagnosing connectivity issues or verifying that specific network services are operational.*

*While legitimate in nature, attackers can misuse it to probe remote systems for vulnerabilities and gather information about available services, potentially facilitating lateral movement.*

## Legitimate Usage
- **Network Troubleshooting** → Test RPC connectivity between systems to diagnose network issues.
- **Remote Service Monitoring** → Verify that RPC services, such as those used for Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), are functioning on remote machines.
- **System Diagnostics** → Used by administrators to ensure that remote systems are correctly responding to RPC requests.

## How to abuse it
- **Port Scanning & Service Discovery** → Attackers can use ```rpcping.exe``` to identify open RPC ports and services running on remote systems, potentially revealing exploitable targets.
- **Reconnaissance for Lateral Movement** → By testing RPC communication across the network, attackers can identify machines that are accessible for exploitation or lateral movement.
- **Bypassing Network Security** → Because ```rpcping.exe``` is a legitimate Windows utility, it can be used to bypass certain network security controls or monitoring systems.
- **Exfiltration via RPC** → Malicious actors could use ```rpcping.exe``` as part of a broader attack to probe systems and determine if they are capable of receiving and sending data remotely.

## Example attacks
### 1. Reconnaissance for Open RPC Ports
*Attackers can use ```rpcping.exe``` to identify open RPC ports across the network, which can be used for further exploitation or lateral movement.*

**Test RPC Connectivity to Remote Systems**

```
rpcping.exe -t ncacn_ip_tcp -h 192.168.1.50 -p 135
```

**Effect:**
- Identifies whether the remote system at ```192.168.1.50``` has RPC services running on port 135 (commonly used for RPC communication).
- Attackers could use this information to target systems for further attacks.

### 2. Service Discovery for Exploitation
*By probing for open RPC services, attackers can discover systems running vulnerable services (e.g., WMI) that could be exploited.*

**Probe Remote System for RPC Services**

```
rpcping.exe -t ncacn_ip_tcp -h 192.168.1.100 -p 135
```

**Effect:**
- Checks if the remote machine at ```192.168.1.100``` has active RPC services, which could be potential attack vectors if misconfigured or unpatched.

### 3. Bypassing Firewall Rules for Lateral Movement
*Using ```rpcping.exe``` to check RPC availability can be part of a lateral movement strategy, bypassing firewalls or network monitoring systems.*

**Use ```rpcping.exe``` for Lateral Movement Discovery**

```
rpcping.exe -t ncacn_ip_tcp -h 192.168.1.50 -p 135
```

**Effect:**
- Can be used by attackers to probe for systems that allow RPC communication and could be targeted for lateral movement, often undetected due to the legitimate nature of the tool.

### 4. Exploiting Vulnerabilities via RPC
*Attackers could use the information gained from ```rpcping.exe``` to target known vulnerabilities in RPC services (e.g., MS08-067) for remote code execution.*

**Identify Vulnerable RPC Services**

```
rpcping.exe -t ncacn_ip_tcp -h 192.168.1.50 -p 135
```

**Effect:**
- Attackers can identify accessible RPC services and target them for known vulnerabilities in the service or software.

### 5. Exfiltration via RPC
*After compromising a system, attackers can use RPC to exfiltrate data, using ```rpcping.exe``` to identify open communication channels for the data transfer.*

**Initiate RPC Communication to Exfiltrate Data**

```
rpcping.exe -t ncacn_ip_tcp -h 192.168.1.50 -p 135
```

**Effect:**
- Establishes an RPC connection to a target system, potentially used for data exfiltration or remote command execution.

# Detection & Mitigation
## Detection Methods
**Monitor RPC Communication**
- **Event ID 4688 (Process Creation)** → Detect the use of ```rpcping.exe``` on systems and monitor for suspicious command-line arguments.
- **Network Traffic Analysis** → Monitor network traffic for unusual RPC communication that could indicate reconnaissance or lateral movement activities.

**Service Discovery**
- **Audit Port Scanning** → Look for signs of port scanning or enumeration attempts, especially using RPC tools like ```rpcping.exe```.

**Unusual RPC Requests**
- **Monitor RPC Service Access** → Identify any unexpected or unauthorized access attempts to RPC services, especially those coming from non-administrative systems.

## Mitigation Strategies
- **Restrict RPC Access** → Use firewalls to block unauthorized access to RPC services or restrict access to trusted IPs only.
- **Use Network Segmentation** → Isolate critical systems and RPC services from untrusted networks to reduce the attack surface.
- **Disable Unnecessary Services** → Disable or limit the use of unnecessary RPC services to reduce potential attack vectors.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** → Configure IDS to alert on suspicious RPC traffic or scanning activities from tools like ```rpcping.exe```.
