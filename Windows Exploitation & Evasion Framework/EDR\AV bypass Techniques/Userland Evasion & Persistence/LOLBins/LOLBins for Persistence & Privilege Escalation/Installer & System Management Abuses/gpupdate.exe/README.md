# gpupdate.exe
## What is it?
*```gpupdate.exe``` is a command-line tool in Windows that is used to refresh Group Policy settings on a local machine or domain. It ensures that any changes made to Group Policy are applied immediately, instead of waiting for the next background refresh cycle.*

*It is typically used by system administrators to enforce group policies across a system or network. However, due to its trusted nature, it can be misused by attackers to execute malicious tasks or gain persistence.*

## Legitimate Usage
- **Force Group Policy Update** → Use ```gpupdate.exe``` to immediately apply changes to system policies, including security settings or user permissions.
- **System Configuration Management** → Administrators often use it to enforce security configurations on a machine without waiting for the next automatic refresh.
- **Testing Group Policy Changes** → Useful for testing new Group Policy settings in real-time to ensure they apply as intended.

## How to abuse it
- **Persistence via Group Policy** → Attackers can use ```gpupdate.exe``` to force an update of a malicious Group Policy or persistence mechanism they have configured.
- **Execution of Malicious Scripts** → Attackers may execute malicious scripts or payloads via group policy configurations that are triggered by ```gpupdate.exe``` refresh.
- **Bypassing Security Controls** → Attackers may change Group Policy settings to disable security features (e.g., Windows Defender) or alter security monitoring settings.
- **Escalating Privileges** → Malicious Group Policies can be configured to escalate privileges or grant backdoor access, and then forced to refresh with ```gpupdate.exe```.

## Example attacks
### 1. Persistence via Malicious Group Policy
*Attackers can configure a malicious Group Policy to execute a payload or maintain persistence. By running ```gpupdate.exe```, they can ensure that the policy is enforced immediately.*

**Force Malicious Policy Update**

```
gpupdate /force
```

**Effect:**
- Forces the immediate application of a malicious Group Policy that could result in unauthorized access, persistence, or execution of malicious code.

### 2. Disabling Security Features
*Attackers may use ```gpupdate.exe``` to apply a Group Policy that disables critical security measures such as Windows Defender, firewall settings, or auditing.*

**Disable Windows Defender via Group Policy**

```
gpupdate /force
```

**Effect:**
- Group Policy changes disable Windows Defender, allowing for further malicious activity without detection.

### 3. Running Malicious Scripts via Group Policy
*Attackers can configure Group Policy to run a malicious script and use ```gpupdate.exe``` to force its execution immediately.*

**Execute Malicious Script via Group Policy**

```
gpupdate /force
```

**Effect:**
- Executes a malicious PowerShell script or executable as defined in the Group Policy settings.

### 4. Bypassing Security Monitoring Tools
*An attacker can force a Group Policy refresh to disable security logging or system monitoring.*

**Disable Event Log Monitoring**

```
gpupdate /force
```

**Effect:**
- Updates Group Policy to prevent security logging or disable auditing features, aiding in hiding traces of malicious activity.

### 5. Privilege Escalation via Group Policy
*Attackers may manipulate Group Policy to grant themselves administrative privileges, and force it to apply immediately using ```gpupdate.exe```.*

**Grant Admin Privileges via Group Policy**

```
gpupdate /force
```

**Effect:**
- The attacker immediately gains administrative access, allowing further exploitation of the system.

# Detection & Mitigation
## Detection Methods
**Monitor Group Policy Changes**
- **Event ID 4739 (Group Policy Modifications)** → Detect unauthorized changes to Group Policy, especially those targeting security-related settings.
- **Look for frequent or unexpected use of ```gpupdate.exe```**, particularly by non-administrative users or on sensitive systems.
- **Event ID 4732 (Member Added to Group)** → Track suspicious additions to privileged groups via Group Policy settings.

**Monitor Execution of Malicious Scripts**
- **Event ID 4688 (Process Creation)** → Detect suspicious or unauthorized processes being triggered by ```gpupdate.exe``` (e.g., script execution or payload delivery).
- **Audit Scripts** → Ensure scripts invoked by Group Policy are from trusted locations and signed.

## Mitigation Strategies
- **Restrict Access to Group Policy** → Limit access to modify or update Group Policies to trusted administrators only.
- **Use Application Whitelisting** → Prevent unauthorized executables or scripts from being executed by blocking unknown or untrusted files.
- **Monitor Group Policy Updates** → Audit and monitor all Group Policy updates to detect unauthorized changes.
- **Implement Strict User Permissions** → Ensure that only necessary users have access to run ```gpupdate.exe``` or modify Group Policies.
- **Use Antivirus/Endpoint Protection** → Ensure that real-time protection is active to detect malicious scripts or unauthorized changes to Group Policy.
