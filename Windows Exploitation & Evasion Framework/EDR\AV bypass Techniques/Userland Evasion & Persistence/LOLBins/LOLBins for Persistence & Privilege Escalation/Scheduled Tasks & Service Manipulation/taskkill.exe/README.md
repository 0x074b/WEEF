# taskkill.exe
## What is it?
*```taskkill.exe``` is a built-in Windows command-line tool used to **terminate processes** by name or process ID (PID). It provides an alternative to Task Manager for **killing running applications or background services**.*

*Since it is a **trusted system utility**, attackers frequently abuse ```taskkill.exe``` to **disable security tools, kill forensic processes, and evade detection**.*

## Legitimate Usage
- **Forcefully Terminate Stuck Processes** → End unresponsive applications.
- **Close Multiple Processes Simultaneously** → Kill all instances of a specific program.
- **Automate Process Management** → Use in scripts for system maintenance.
- **Shut Down Unnecessary Background Services** → Free up system resources.

## How to abuse it
- **Disabling Security Software** → Terminate antivirus (AV), endpoint detection (EDR), or logging tools.
- **Killing Forensic & Monitoring Processes** → Prevent system administrators from detecting attacks.
- **Persistence & Defense Evasion** → Shut down protection tools before executing malicious payloads.
- **Privilege Escalation** → Terminate security controls that prevent privilege escalation exploits.

## Example attacks
### 1. Disabling Windows Defender & Security Tools
*Attackers can use ```taskkill.exe``` to stop security-related processes, making detection harder.*

**Terminate Windows Defender**

```
taskkill /F /IM MsMpEng.exe
```

**Effect:**
- **Kills the Windows Defender process**, disabling real-time protection.
- **Allows malware to execute without interference**.

**Kill Multiple Security Tools Simultaneously**

```
taskkill /F /IM MsMpEng.exe /IM WinDefend.exe /IM EDRService.exe
```

**Effect:**
- **Shuts down multiple security processes in one command**.
- **Can be executed via scripts for automation**.

### 2. Killing Forensic & Monitoring Tools
*Attackers remove forensic tools that could reveal their presence.*

```
taskkill /F /IM Procmon.exe /IM Wireshark.exe /IM Sysmon.exe
```

**Effect:**
- **Forces termination of forensic tools**, preventing analysis.
- **Blocks monitoring of malicious activity**.

### 3. Terminating Specific Processes by Process ID (PID)
*Attackers can target specific instances of a running program for precision control.*

```
taskkill /F /PID 1234 /PID 5678
```

**Effect:**
- **Ends only the specified processes**, avoiding unnecessary system disruptions.

### 4. Mass Killing of All Processes Matching a Pattern
*Attackers can terminate all processes that contain a specific keyword in their name.*

```
for /F "tokens=2 delims=," %i in ('tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq notepad*" /FO CSV') do taskkill /PID %i /F
```

**Effect:**
- **Finds all running instances of Notepad and kills them**.
- **Can be modified to target security-related processes dynamically**.

### 5. Killing Processes on Remote Machines
*Attackers can terminate processes on remote systems if they have administrative access.*

```
taskkill /S 192.168.1.50 /U admin /P password /IM defender.exe /F
```

**Effect:**
- **Stops security processes on another system**, aiding lateral movement.
- **Requires administrative privileges on the target machine**.

# Detection & Mitigation
## Detection Methods
**Monitor Task Termination Events**
- **Event ID 4689 (Process Termination)** → Look for security tool processes being forcefully closed.
- **Check for ```taskkill.exe``` Executions** → Frequent or automated process termination is suspicious.

**Detect Security Tool Termination**
- **Monitor Logs for Killed Security Processes** (e.g., Windows Defender, Sysmon, EDR tools).
- **Look for Mass Process Terminations** → Scripts that kill multiple processes may indicate an attack.

## Mitigation Strategies
- **Restrict Taskkill Usage** → Use group policies to prevent non-admin users from executing ```taskkill.exe```.
- **Monitor & Alert on Security Process Termination** → Set up SIEM rules to detect and alert on attempts to kill security software.
- **Use Tamper Protection** → Enable protection on security tools to prevent unauthorized termination.
- **Implement Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)** → Detect and block malicious process termination attempts.
