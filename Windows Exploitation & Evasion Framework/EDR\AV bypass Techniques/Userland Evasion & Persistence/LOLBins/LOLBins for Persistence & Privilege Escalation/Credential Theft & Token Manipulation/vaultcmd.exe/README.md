# vaultcmd.exe
## What is it?
*```vaultcmd.exe``` is a built-in Windows command-line tool used to manage credentials stored in the Windows Credential Manager. It allows users to add, delete, or list credentials, and perform other actions related to credential management.*

*While designed for legitimate administrative use, attackers can abuse ```vaultcmd.exe``` to steal or manipulate stored credentials, which can then be used for further attacks or lateral movement across systems.*

## Legitimate Usage
- **Managing Credentials** → Add, remove, or list credentials in the Windows Credential Manager to simplify access to network resources.
- **Automated Authentication** → Use saved credentials for automated scripts or applications that need to access network resources securely.
- **System Administration** → Administrators use ```vaultcmd.exe``` to manage credentials for remote systems or services.

## How to abuse it
- **Credential Harvesting** → Attackers can use ```vaultcmd.exe``` to list and export credentials stored in the Windows Credential Manager, potentially stealing sensitive information like passwords or tokens.
- **Lateral Movement** → Stolen credentials can be used to move laterally across a network or access other systems with similar credentials.
- **Persistence** → Attackers can store malicious credentials in the Windows Credential Manager to maintain access or escalate privileges in the future.
- **Privilege Escalation** → Attackers can manipulate or inject credentials into the system to gain elevated access, bypassing security measures like UAC or password protection.

## Example attacks
### 1. Credential Harvesting
*Attackers can use ```vaultcmd.exe``` to list and export stored credentials, gaining access to sensitive systems or services.*

**List Stored Credentials**

```
vaultcmd /list
```

**Effect:**
- Lists all credentials stored in the Windows Credential Manager, potentially exposing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and tokens.

### 2. Storing Malicious Credentials for Persistence
*Attackers can add malicious credentials to the Windows Credential Manager, allowing them to maintain access to the system or network resources.*

**Add Malicious Credentials**

```
vaultcmd /add /name:"attacker" /user:"attacker" /password:"malicious_password"
```

**Effect:**
- Adds a new set of malicious credentials to the Windows Credential Manager, allowing the attacker to authenticate as the user `attacker` in the future.

### 3. Credential Injection for Lateral Movement
*Attackers can use ```vaultcmd.exe``` to inject stolen credentials into the Windows Credential Manager for lateral movement across systems.*

**Inject Stolen Credentials**

```
vaultcmd /add /name:"user@domain" /user:"user" /password:"stolen_password"
```

**Effect:**
- Adds stolen credentials to the Credential Manager, allowing the attacker to access other systems or services that require these credentials.

### 4. Using Stolen Credentials for Privilege Escalation
*Attackers can use stored credentials to escalate their privileges or access restricted systems.*

**Use Stolen Credentials to Access a System**

```
vaultcmd /use /name:"admin" /user:"admin_user" /password:"escalated_password"
```

**Effect:**
- Attempts to use the stolen credentials to access an elevated system or service, bypassing regular access control measures.

### 5. Maintaining Access via Stored Credentials
*Attackers can store credentials in the Windows Credential Manager to ensure continued access to systems even if the initial compromise is discovered.*

**Store Persistent Credentials**

```
vaultcmd /add /name:"persistent_access" /user:"attacker" /password:"backdoor_password"
```

**Effect:**
- Adds a persistent set of credentials for continued access to the system, even if the attacker is kicked off the system or the initial access point is closed.

# Detection & Mitigation
## Detection Methods
**Monitor for Suspicious Use of ```vaultcmd.exe```**
- **Event ID 4688 (Process Creation)** → Look for instances where ```vaultcmd.exe``` is being executed, especially if it is not part of normal administrative workflows.
- **Audit Credential Manager Access** → Track access to and modification of the Windows Credential Manager to detect unusual behavior.

**Detect Unauthorized Credentials Addition**
- **Monitor New Credential Additions** → Watch for the addition of unknown or unauthorized credentials in the Credential Manager.
- **Analyze Command-Line Arguments** → Watch for the use of ```vaultcmd.exe``` with suspicious command-line arguments, such as adding credentials without justification.

**Audit for Lateral Movement**
- **Network Traffic Analysis** → Monitor for unusual network connections that may indicate lateral movement using stored credentials.

## Mitigation Strategies
- **Restrict Access to ```vaultcmd.exe```** → Limit who can execute ```vaultcmd.exe``` by restricting access to administrative accounts only.
- **Use Application Whitelisting** → Prevent unauthorized execution of ```vaultcmd.exe``` by non-administrative users.
- **Monitor for Credential Manager Changes** → Regularly audit the Windows Credential Manager for changes, additions, or deletions of credentials.
- **Encrypt Sensitive Data** → Ensure that credentials stored in the Credential Manager are encrypted and cannot be easily accessed or manipulated.
- **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** → Use MFA to reduce the effectiveness of stolen credentials, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have valid credentials.
