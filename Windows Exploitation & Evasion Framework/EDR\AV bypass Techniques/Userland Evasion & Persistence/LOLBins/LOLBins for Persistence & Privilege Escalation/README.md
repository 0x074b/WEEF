# Scheduled Tasks & Service Manipulation
*Exploiting Windows task scheduling and service management to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.*
*( 1 → 5 = stealth level, 5 being the stealthiest )*

- **psexec.exe** → 1
  - Creates a **remote service** (```PSEXESVC```), which is highly **visible in logs**.
  - **Triggers network events** (SMB, RPC).
  - Generates **logon events** (Event ID 4624, 4648).
  - **Frequently flagged by EDR/AV** due to its heavy use in **lateral movement**.

- **sc.exe** → 2
  - Used to **create, modify, or delete services**, making it highly **visible** in **Event Logs** (Event ID 7045 - Service Creation).
  - Requires **administrative privileges**, further increasing detection risks.
  - **Less noisy than PsExec** because it does not create **new logon events** or use **SMB**.

- **schtasks.exe** → 3
  - Creates **scheduled tasks**, which can be **monitored in Event Logs** (Event ID 4698 - Scheduled Task Created).
  - Commonly abused for **persistence**, but **often blended with legitimate activity**.
  - **Less suspicious than service creation** but still detectable.

- **taskkill.exe** → 1
  - Used to **terminate processes**, leaving **fewer forensic artifacts** compared to the others.
  - May trigger **Event ID 4688 (Process Execution)** or **EDR alerts**, but **not as loud** as service creation.
  - Blends into normal admin activity.

- wmic.exe → 4
  - Executes **WMI queries**, which are **often overlooked** in logs.
  - Can perform **remote process execution, reconnaissance, and persistence** with minimal footprint.
  - Leaves logs, but detection is harder since WMI is used by **system processes** and **legitimate admins**.
  - **Frequently abused in stealthy attacks (e.g., fileless malware, LOLBins)**.

# Registry-Based Persistence & UAC Bypass
*Using the Windows registry to ensure malicious execution at startup or to bypass User Account Control (UAC).*
