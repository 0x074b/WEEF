# mavinject.exe
## What is it?
*```mavinject.exe``` is a legitimate utility developed by Microsoft that is used for managing and injecting malware into the system for various purposes, including Windows debugging and analysis. It is typically part of the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine (MMPE), which is integrated into tools like Microsoft Defender Antivirus (MAV).*

## Legitimate Usage
- **Debugging & Malware Analysis** → Used by security researchers or Microsoft for analyzing malware samples and testing the behavior of antivirus software.
- **Injecting Payloads for Testing** → Allows researchers to inject specific test files into the system in a controlled manner for analysis.
- **Integrating with Antivirus Systems** → Utilized in conjunction with antivirus programs to aid in the testing and debugging of malware detection methods.

## How to abuse it
- **Injecting Malicious Code** → Attackers can abuse ```mavinject.exe``` to inject malicious payloads into processes, potentially gaining control over the system.
- **Bypassing Security Controls** → Since ```mavinject.exe``` is a legitimate tool, security tools might overlook it or fail to flag its misuse.
- **Persistence via Injection** → Attackers can use ```mavinject.exe``` to inject malicious code into trusted processes, making it harder to detect and remove.
- **Lateral Movement** → Used to inject payloads into remote systems or propagate malware across a network.

## Example attacks
### 1. Malicious Code Injection
*Attackers can use ```mavinject.exe``` to inject a payload into a running process for execution.*
**Inject Malicious Payload into Notepad**

```
mavinject.exe -i notepad.exe -p C:\path\to\malicious.dll
```

**Effect:**
- The malicious payload (DLL) is injected into the ```notepad.exe``` process, allowing it to run undetected.

### 2. Bypassing Antivirus Detection
*Since ```mavinject.exe``` is part of Microsoft’s own antivirus tools, its use may be overlooked by security software.*
**Use ```mavinject.exe``` for Stealthy Payload Injection**

```
mavinject.exe -i C:\Windows\System32\explorer.exe -p C:\path\to\malicious.dll
```

**Effect:**
- Injects malicious code into the trusted ```explorer.exe``` process, bypassing security controls and potentially evading detection by antivirus software.

### 3. Persistence via Process Injection
*Attackers can use ```mavinject.exe``` to inject malicious payloads into trusted processes to maintain persistence on the system.*
**Inject Malicious Code into svchost.exe**

```
mavinject.exe -i svchost.exe -p C:\path\to\persistence.dll
```

**Effect:**
- The persistence mechanism is injected into a critical system process, ensuring that it remains active even after reboots.

### 4. Lateral Movement in Networked Systems
*Attackers can use ```mavinject.exe``` to inject malicious payloads into remote systems and spread malware across the network.*
**Inject Payload into Remote Process**

```
mavinject.exe -i \192.168.1.10\c$\Windows\System32\cmd.exe -p C:\path\to\payload.dll
```

**Effect:**
- This command remotely injects a payload into a system on the network, enabling further compromise and lateral movement.

### 5. Abuse for Fileless Malware
*By using ```mavinject.exe``` to inject code into running processes, attackers can execute payloads without writing them to disk, reducing the chances of detection by traditional file-based security systems.*
**Inject Fileless Malware into Running Process**

```
mavinject.exe -i C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe -p C:\path\to\fileless_payload.dll
```

**Effect:**
- Executes the fileless payload in memory without the need to create any files on disk, evading detection by file-based antivirus tools.

# Detection & Mitigation
## Detection Methods
**Monitor Process Injection**
- **Event ID 4688 (Process Creation)** → Look for ```mavinject.exe``` being used to inject code into trusted processes.
- **Analyze Process Memory** → Scan for anomalous code injection patterns in running processes like ```svchost.exe``` or ```explorer.exe```.

**Monitor Suspicious DLL Injection**
- **Event ID 4688 (Process Creation)** → Identify processes spawning with unusual DLL injection, especially when ```mavinject.exe``` is used.

**Check for Fileless Malware**
- **Behavioral Analysis** → Monitor for fileless malware behaviors, such as payloads running directly from memory without being written to disk.

## Mitigation Strategies
- **Restrict Use of ```mavinject.exe```** → Use application whitelisting solutions such as AppLocker to restrict access to ```mavinject.exe``` and similar tools.
- **Monitor for Unusual Process Behavior** → Employ endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to track and analyze process injection activity.
- **Prevent Remote Process Injection** → Restrict remote access and the ability to inject code into processes on remote systems via network-based protections.
- **Enhance Antivirus/EDR Detection** → Ensure that security tools are configured to detect and flag suspicious code injections and fileless malware behaviors.
