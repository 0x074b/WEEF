# Introduction
### Hijacking and Code Injection (Code Injection)
*(Techniques to execute malicious code in legitimate processes by manipulating the memory or execution mechanisms of Windows.)*

*The purpose of code injection is to run malware through a legitimate process to circumvent protections such as antivirus (AV) and behavioural detection solutions (BDUs). These methods also make it possible to escape forensic analysis and to maintain persistence in the system.*

# Code Injection Techniques
*Conventional injection methods use Windows APIs to write and execute code in a remote process.*
