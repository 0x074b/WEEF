# Early Bird Injection
***Early Bird Injection** is an advanced **code injection technique** that allows an attacker to inject malicious code into a process **before it starts executing**.
By taking advantage of a process’s early execution phase, attackers can execute their payload **before security tools (AV, EDR) can analyze it**.*

## Why Use Early Bird Injection?
- Happens before traditional security tools can detect it
- Avoids process hollowing and other detectable modifications
- Runs within a legitimate process, reducing suspicion

*Unlike **Process Hollowing** (which replaces the memory of an existing process) or **DLL Injection** (which injects code into an already running process), Early Bird Injection **injects code before the process starts executing**, making it harder to detect.*

> [!NOTE]
> **Early Bird Injection** is one of the **stealthiest** methods because it **hijacks a process before security tools analyze it**.

# How Early Bird Injection Works

### 1. Create a Suspended Process
  - The attacker **creates a new process in a suspended state** using ```CreateProcess()``` with the ```CREATE_SUSPENDED``` flag.
  - This prevents the process from immediately executing, allowing modification before it starts.

### 2. Locate the Process Environment Block (PEB)
  - The attacker accesses the **PEB (Process Environment Block)**, which contains information about the newly created process.
  - This is done using ```NtQueryInformationProcess()``` to retrieve the ```PROCESS_BASIC_INFORMATION``` structure.

### 3. Inject Malicious Code into the Process
  - The attacker allocates memory in the suspended process using ```VirtualAllocEx()```.
  - The malicious payload is written into the allocated memory using ```WriteProcessMemory()```.

### 4. Modify the Thread Context
  - The attacker retrieves the **main thread context** using ```GetThreadContext()```.
  - The **Instruction Pointer (EIP/RIP) is modified** to point to the injected malicious code instead of the original process entry point.

### 5. Resume Execution of the Process
  - The attacker resumes the process using ```ResumeThread()```.
  - The process starts execution, but instead of running its legitimate code, it executes the attacker’s payload.

# Detection and Defense Against Early Bird Injection
## How to Detect Early Bird Injection?

- **Monitor Suspended Process Creation** – Detect ```CreateProcess()``` calls with the ```CREATE_SUSPENDED``` flag.
- **Inspect Thread Context Changes** – If a thread’s EIP/RIP suddenly points to an unexpected memory region, it may be hijacked.
- **Analyze Memory Modifications** – Look for ```VirtualAllocEx()``` and ```WriteProcessMemory()``` calls in newly created processes.
- **Monitor Unusual ResumeThread() Calls** – If a thread is resumed but executes unexpected code, it could be an injection.

## Defense Techniques

- **Use Advanced EDR Solutions** – Traditional antivirus may not detect this method, but behavioral monitoring can.
- **Restrict API Access** – Prevent unauthorized use of ```NtQueryInformationProcess()``` and ```SetThreadContext()```.
- **Enable Security Logging** – Windows Event Logging can capture unusual process suspensions and modifications.
- **Monitor Memory Allocation in Suspended Processes** – If memory is allocated before a process starts, it could indicate injection.#
