# Hook Injection
***Hook Injection** is a technique used by attackers to **intercept and manipulate function calls or events within a program**.
By injecting hooks into a target process, an attacker can alter the behavior of the application, monitor activities, or inject malicious code.
Hook Injection is commonly used to modify the functionality of legitimate software, steal sensitive information, or **inject malicious payloads**.*

## What is Hooking?
***Hooking** is a technique where an attacker alters the execution flow of a program by inserting custom code, known as a "hook," into the address space of a process.
Hooks can be used to intercept function calls, modify arguments, or replace the execution of a function entirely.*

## Why Use Hook Injection?
*Attackers may use Hook Injection for several reasons, including:*

- **Intercepting API calls** – Manipulate how an application interacts with the operating system or other programs.
- **Monitoring activity** – Track user actions like keystrokes, mouse movements, or network traffic (e.g., keylogging).
- **Modifying behavior** – Change the functionality of a program, bypass security controls, or implement cheats in games.
- **Injecting malicious payloads** – Hook into functions to execute arbitrary code inside the targeted process.

# How Hook Injection Works
*The process of Hook Injection generally follows these steps:*

1. **Identify the Target Process** – The attacker identifies a process that they want to hook into. This can be a program with sensitive data or one that performs specific tasks (like games or security software).
2. **Locate the Function to Hook** – The attacker identifies a function in the target application that they want to intercept (e.g., a function that processes user input or communicates over the network).
3. **Inject the Hook** – The attacker then injects their hook into the target process. This could involve modifying the import address table (IAT) or using more advanced techniques like **API hooking**, **inline hooking**, or **VTable hooking**.
4. **Modify the Function's Behavior** – Once the hook is in place, the attacker's code is executed instead of the original function. The attacker can modify arguments, execute custom code, or completely replace the function's behavior.
5. **Restore Control** – After the hook executes, the attacker may allow the original function to run or return control to the application, depending on the attack's goal.

## Types of Hooking Methods
- **API Hooking** – Involves intercepting system or application programming interface (API) calls. It can be used to manipulate the behavior of OS functions or application-specific functions.
- **Inline Hooking** – The attacker modifies the beginning of a function's code to redirect the flow to the malicious code. This is usually done by replacing the first few bytes of the target function with a jump instruction.
- **VTable Hooking** – Used with object-oriented programs, this method hooks into the virtual function table (VTable) of an object to intercept method calls.
- **Import Address Table (IAT) Hooking** – The attacker modifies the IAT of the application to point to their own malicious code instead of the original function.

## Example: Keylogging with Hook Injection
*A common use case for hook injection is keylogging, where the attacker hooks into the system’s keyboard input function to monitor keystrokes. Here's a simple example:*

1. The attacker injects a hook into the target process that intercepts calls to the ```GetMessage()``` API function, which retrieves user input messages.
2. Instead of allowing the function to pass on the input, the hook logs every keystroke the user types.
3. The attacker can then collect sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or other personal data.

# Defense Against Hook Injection
*To protect against Hook Injection, several security measures can be taken:*

- **Code Integrity Checks** – Implement checks to ensure that critical system functions and APIs have not been altered or hooked.
- **Use of Anti-Hooking Techniques** – Employ techniques to detect and block hooking activities, such as validating the integrity of system APIs and monitoring function calls.
- **User Mode and Kernel Mode Protection** – Ensure that sensitive operations are protected in kernel space, making it harder for user-mode applications to hook system functions.
- **Behavioral Monitoring** – Use Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions that can detect unusual behavior, such as suspicious function calls, unusual API imports, or modifications to function pointers.
- **Application Whitelisting** – Restrict applications to a set of known, trusted programs, and prevent unauthorized software from running on the system.
